# Question 1 : 
# Language use : Python 

For the question one i create the list and the variables odd and even 
I used the for loop or go through the elements of my list. If an element divided by two gives us 0 then it's
an even number and if it gives a number different from 0 it gives an odd so the variables
odd or even comes into action each time that has even or odd.

# Question2 :
# Language use : Python 

The first step is the 
Creating a node for the list that is doubly linked with the previous node pointer, this is what will allow us to move it back and forth.
then we use a double list with the creation of a doublelist class: this allows an advancement on the list each time an element marks None
When it has browsed our list if the head =None then our pointer allows an advancement on our list but the most interesting thing is that we have done the same to restart from the reverse send we have created a prec_node variable that allows us to restart from the back while starting verse on the following table view that signals as None
