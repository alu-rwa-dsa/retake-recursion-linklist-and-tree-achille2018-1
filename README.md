# Question 1 : 
# Language use : Python 

For the question one i create the list and the variables odd and even 
I used the for loop or go through the elements of my list. If an element divided by two gives us 0 then it's
an even number and if it gives a number different from 0 it gives an odd so the variables
odd or even comes into action each time that has even or odd.
To run my program I just use an extension (run or debugging and run ) in Pycharm a software adapted for Python.
